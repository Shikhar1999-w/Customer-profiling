# Observation and conclusions
For the retail store dataset:
- Almost all of the customers are from United Kindom (UK), with a small significant portion from Germany and Franch. Remaining from other parts of the world.
- Top 3 customer segments with most customers are:
  - Potential loyalists
  - Customer Needing Attention
  - Loyal customers
- This shows that the retail store is significantly good in the market as it has converted most of its customers into loyal ones or they can be made loyal customers. This is crucial for any company that aims for customer acquisition, as this means a marketing strategy aimed towards potential loyalists customers will affect company's large no. of customers and thus leading to effective marketing strategy.
